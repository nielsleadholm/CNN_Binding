# CNN_Binding

TensorFlow Core implementation of 'hierarchical feature binding' in convolutional neural networks, and support code to evaluate adversarial vulnerability. 
For information on hierarchical feature binding, see the paper "The Emergence of Polychronization and Feature Binding in a Spiking Neural Network Model of the Primate Ventral Visual System", Eguchi, 2018 (http://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2018-25960-001.html)
