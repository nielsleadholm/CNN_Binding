# CNN_Binding

TensorFlow implementation of a simple CNN based on the architecture of LeNet-5, for the MNIST dataset. The easiest way to get started is to load the included Jupyter notebook in Colaboratory (https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb)
Further modifications are intended to implement 'hierarchical feature binding' in a deep learning context.
For information on hierarchical feature binding, see the paper "The Emergence of Polychronization and Feature Binding in a Spiking Neural Network Model of the Primate Ventral Visual System", Eguchi, 2018 (http://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2018-25960-001.html)
